Welcome to quake reblance, a mod compliation of reblancing quake by aking everything OP and unfair!

Some of the mods such as weapons were done by following/editing some tutorials: http://www.quakewiki.net/archives/qdevels/ It's a great website!

Commands to enable some stuff:

play_[number here]: plays a sound
cmd_boots= makes gravity go extremely low
items: Items spawns faster, some items doesn't give you anything, and some items kills you. It's your job to determine what does what :)
