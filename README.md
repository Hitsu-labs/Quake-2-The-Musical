Final project for it266
This quake mode complaination is basically making quake unfair and whacky. Some items that were suppose to give you stuff, no longer gives you stuff.
some items will even respawn faster. Other mods consists of editing with gravity by pressing the button 9 (if you have the config file)
Weapon mods may consist of proxmity mines, fast throwing grenades, and, other stuff. Some Weapon mods will not do anything spectacular and it 
will be just a stat change, model changes. Some of the mods were based off tutorials that were found from the web (http://www.quakewiki.net/archives/qdevels/).
I then used what I've learned from those mods to make cool new things! Hope you enjoy it, it's been a long semester...zzzz.zzzz


Commands to know:

cmd boots = gives you less gravity!
cmd play_[insert number up to 8 here]= plays an assigned sound, bind this to numpad!
