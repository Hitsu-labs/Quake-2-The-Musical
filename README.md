Final project for it266
This quake mod is basically making quake unfair and whacky. The mods consists of editing with gravity by pressing the button 9 (if you have the config file)
Weapon mods may consist of proxmity mines, fast throwing grenades, and, other stuff. Some Weapon mods will not do anything spectacular and it will be just a stat change, model changes. Some of the mods were based off tutorials that were found from the web.
The highlight of this mod is that you can use the numpad on your keyboard as a drumpad! Press a numberkey from there and your character will play a sound, other players will also hear this sound. The idea is to make a beat in multiplayer with friends! : D

I then used what I've learned from those mods to make cool new things! Hope you all enjoy it, it's been a long semester.


Commands to know:

cmd boots = gives you less gravity! or press numpad 9 to toggle if you use the config file
cmd play_[insert number up to 8 here]= plays an assigned sound, bind this to numpad! orpress 1-8 on the numpad if you use the config file!
